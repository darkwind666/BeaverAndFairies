# Description

Space Beaver - a simple, addictive, mini game that you can play with the touch of a finger. You need to swipe your finger in the direction of the falling blocks (swipe left, right, up, down, or tap). There are also deceleration bonuses and removal unit bonuses. The game has a store with fairies :)

One day, beaver was walking in the forest collecting mushrooms. In the distance he saw a fog. Beaver went into the fog and fell asleep. He dreamed of space - stars and galaxies rushing over his head. To get closer, beaver must quickly solve geometric signs. Help beaver get as far as possible and unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Features:
- simple and fun gameplay with one finger
- 3 levels of difficulty 
- bonuses and fairies
- beautiful space graphics 
- beautiful soundtracks
- integration with facebook and VK
- game version for apple watch
- cool stickers with emojis
- the game does not require any purchases (not even to unlock features!)

The game is convenient to use in the subway, or while waiting for any meeting to start.
